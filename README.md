## Description

Welcome to the Weather Forecast Application! This web application
demonstrates my skills as a full stack developer, utilizing the OpenWeather
API to retrieve real-time weather data. Users can input a zip code to
receive the current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast, showcasing
my ability to work with external APIs and manipulate dynamic data.
Throughout the development of this application, I gained hands-on experience
with API integration, data parsing, and display. This project aims to
provide a seamless user experience, highlighting my proficiency in
building interactive and data-driven applications.
